# Gemastik

GEMASTIK (Pagelaran Mahasiswa Nasional Bidang Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi) is an annual national competition for Indonesian university students in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Organized by the National Achievement Center of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, GEMASTIK aims to enhance the competence of Indonesian students in ICT. The competition features 11 divisions, including programming, cybersecurity, data mining, and game development. GEMASTIK serves as a platform for students to showcase their skills, foster innovation, and contribute to Indonesia's technological advancement, particularly in the context of Industry 4.0 and the upcoming Society 5.0 era.

## Personal Note

This year, I'm participating in Gemastik primarily for the learning experience. It's an opportunity to challenge myself, gain valuable insights, and grow my skills in the tech field. While the competition aspect is exciting, my main focus is on the journey of personal and professional development that Gemastik offers.
